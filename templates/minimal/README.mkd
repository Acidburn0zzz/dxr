Minimal, An HTML-Only Example Template
======================================

This is **very** minimalistic template for DXR, it here to serve as a basic
example of how to write a template. That does not mean that this template is
great starting point for writing a template, although this might be the case
if you're really good with stylesheets.

See Templating.mkd, for details on writing templates for DXR.
