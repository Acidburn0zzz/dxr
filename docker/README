This directory is copied up to the container, and is set as the WORKDIR.
So if you run `dxr index`, that happens here.

Usage of the docker environment:
Put a dxr.config and source code directory here.

In the parent (repository root):

Run an elasticsearch docker container, and expose port 8000.
make es
make image
make index clean serve
