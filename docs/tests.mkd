Automated Testing of DXR
========================
_This document describes the automated testing framework for DXR._


Writing Tests for DXR
---------------------
A DXR test is a folder with the name of the test (e.g. `my-dxr-test`) located in
the `tests/` subfolder of the DXR source directory. The test folder must
contains an executable file with the name of the test prefixed with `run-`,
(e.g. `run-my-dxr-test`). This executable must run the test, clean-up and exit
non-zero if the test failed. The test script will be called with it's own directory
as current working directory.

It's recommended that the test script is used to wrap whatever test logic you
feel like inventing. Have fun...


Running Automated DXR Tests
---------------------------
To run all the DXR tests run the `run-tests.py` script from the `tests/`
subdirectory. Output will be printed to terminal.
Giving the `run-tests.py` script a list of test names as arguments and it will
only run the specified tests.
