Highlighting
============

DXR's source code views support highlighting multiple runs of lines and sharing
those highlighted regions.

There are four ways to highlight. Each way updates the hash portion of the URL
so the highlighted lines can be restored when a page is bookmarked or shared
via chat, bug reports, or so on.

Single Click
------------

Single-click a line to select it. Click it again to deselect it.
Single-clicking a line will also deselect all other lines.

Single Click Then Shift-Click
-----------------------------

After selecting a single line, hold Shift, and click a line above or below it
to highlight the entire range between.

Control- Or Commnd-Click
------------------------

Hold Control or Command (depending on your OS) while clicking a line to add it
to the set of already highlighted lines. Do it again to deselect it.

Control- Or Command-Click, Then Shift-Click
-------------------------------------------

After selecting one or more lines, use Control- or Commnd-Click to highlight
the first in a new range of lines. Then, Shift-click, and the second range will
be added to the existing highlighted set.
