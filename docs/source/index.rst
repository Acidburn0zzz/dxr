Overview
========

DXR is a code search and navigation tool aimed at making sense of large
projects like Firefox. It supports full-text and regex searches as well as
structural queries like "Find all the callers of this function." Behind the
scenes, it indexes both the text and, for supported languages, the structure of
your program, making searches faster and more accurate than is possible with
simple tools like grep.

Here's `an example of DXR running against the Firefox codebase`_.
